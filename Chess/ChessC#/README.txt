CONSOLE TWO PLAYER CHESS

Made by Kyle Furey AKA KrazyK in C# Programming Language

Created on Monday, October 24th, 2022, as a fun side project.

Finished over the course of 113 days, completed on Valentine’s Day 2023.

My code is very long and can definitely be optimized, but you can see my improvement in C# over time. Despite a few hiccups, I am very happy with the result!

If you find any bugs, comment the string of exact moves you took to get there on my Itch page: https://krazyk04.itch.io/chess
