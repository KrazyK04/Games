TO OVERCOME GPU MEMORY USAGE CAUSING LIGHTMAPPER TO SWITCH TO CPU:
1) Clear main game lighting data
2) set mainscenelighting resolution to 1
3) switch to lightingdebugscene
4) clear lightingdebugscene baked lighting data
5) bake lightingdebugscene lighting with the mainscenelighting, save scene
6) switch to TheMainGameScene
7) bake lighting (with resolution of 1), inspect scene for errors (no light, blastouts, etc). SHOULD BE QUICK
8) once done baking, crank resolution to high value (at least 40) and hit bake again. DO NOT CLEAR
9) Lightmapper should not switch to CPU on RTX 3070 or higher at max res of 2048. If it does, then something is wrong
